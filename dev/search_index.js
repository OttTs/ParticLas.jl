Here, f=f(xvt) is the density function at position x, velocity v and time t. The right hand side is the so-called BGK collision operator, where tau is the relaxation time and ft$ is the target distribution function. In the original BGK model, the target distribution function is a simple Maxwellian distribution defined by the number density n, the macroscopic velocity u and the temperature T.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Numerical-model","page":"Home","title":"Numerical model","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The density function is approximated by a large number of simulation particles $     f(x,v,t)\\approx\\sump{\\omegap\\delta(x-xp)\\delta(v-vp)}. $ Each particle is defined by its position x_p and velocity v_p. The weighting factor omega_p defines, how many \"physical\" particles are represented by a single simulation particle. Since there is a huge number of particles in reality, this weighting factor is set to a fairly large number (omega_p=5cdot 10^15 in ParticLas).","category":"page"},{"location":"#Time-stepping","page":"Home","title":"Time stepping","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"When using particles to solve the Boltzmann equation, one usually splits the equation into a movement operator $     \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + v\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0 $ and a collision operator $     \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{\\tau}(f_t - f) $ that are solved successively. This procedure is often called Operator splitting.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Movement-Step","page":"Home","title":"Movement Step","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Particle-insertion","page":"Home","title":"Particle insertion","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Before the particles are moved, new particles are inserted at the left free-stream boundary.

If it hits a wall, it is reflected according to the specific boundary conditions and pushed for the remaining time step. If it crosses a free-stream boundary, it is deleted.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Wall-boundary-condition","page":"Home","title":"Wall boundary condition","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"When Particles hit a wall, two types of reflection can occur. First, there is the specular reflection, where the particle is reflected just like a mirror. The other type of reflection is a diffuse reflection. Here, the particle is reflected with the velocity sampled from a Maxwellian inflow with the wall velocity and temperature.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"In ParticLas, a slider that sets the accomodation coefficient can be used to combine these two types of reflections. This coefficient simply defines the probability of a diffuse reflection vs a specular reflection. If the accomodation coefficient is 0.3, then a particle hitting the wall has a 30% chance of a specular reflection and a 70% chance of a diffuse reflection. The temperature of the walls is set to T_w=600mathrmK.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Collision-Step","page":"Home","title":"Collision Step","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"In order to calculate the relaxation time and target distribution function, the macroscopic variables (number density, bulk velocity and temperature) have to be calculated.
